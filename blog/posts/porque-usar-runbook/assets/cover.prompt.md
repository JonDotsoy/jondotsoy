A wide rectangular banner displaying a top-down view of three distinct books fanned out radially at the bottom center of the frame, exactly mimicking the flat graphic style of the Sneaky Sasquatch game interface without any container or backpack. The book on the far left is solid bright orange with the title \"runbook 1\" written in white, simple sans-serif font above a white stylized play arrow icon. The middle book is solid deep blue with \"runbook 2\" in white text above a white double-arrow 'fast forward' icon. The book on the far right is solid vibrant magenta with \"runbook ∞\" in white text above a large white infinity symbol icon. All books feature thick white lower edges representing pages, solid flat color covers with no gradients or textures, and clean vector-like illustrations. The background is a blurred, low-poly forest environment with flat shades of deep green pine trees and brown ground, identical to the game's aesthetic.
