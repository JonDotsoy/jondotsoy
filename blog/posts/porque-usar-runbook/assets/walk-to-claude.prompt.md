A full-body illustration rendered in the distinct cute, flat Japanese \"Irasutoya\" stock art style, with thick rounded black outlines and simple geometric shapes. The young boy with messy spiky dark brown hair, simple black dot eyes, circular pink blush marks, and a tiny neutral mouth, wearing an oversized bulky burnt orange hooded parka, is walking towards the right. He is holding a brown cardboard box in his arms, labeled with the word \"ideas\" in simple black text. The character is walking on a simple grey floor line against a plain white background. To the far right of the frame is a simple wooden door with a round handle, featuring the orange multi-pointed star logo of Claude centered on its panel, rendered in the same flat, outlined style. The overall scene is simple and clean.
