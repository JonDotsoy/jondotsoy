A full-body illustration in the cute, flat Japanese \"Irasutoya\" stock art style, with thick rounded black outlines and simple geometric shapes. The young boy with messy spiky dark brown hair, simple black dot eyes, circular pink blush marks, and a tiny neutral mouth, wearing an oversized bulky burnt orange hooded parka, is sitting at a simple wooden desk. He is looking at a computer monitor showing a simple spreadsheet. To his side on the desk is an open cardboard box labeled \"PENDIENTES\" in black text. Inside the box is a single piece of paper with the title \"ticket #1\" and the text \"crear runbook\" written below it in simple black font. The desk has a simple keyboard and mouse. The background is a clean, plain white surface. The entire scene, including the character, desk, computer, box, and paper, is rendered in the same simple, flat, outlined style.
