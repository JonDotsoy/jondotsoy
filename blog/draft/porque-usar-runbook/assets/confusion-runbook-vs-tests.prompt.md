A full-body illustration rendered in the distinct cute, flat Japanese \"Irasutoya\" stock art style, characterized by thick rounded black outlines and simple geometric shapes. In the center stands the young boy described previously (messy spiky dark brown hair, dot eyes, pink blush, oversized burnt orange parka, stick legs). He has a clear confused expression, indicated by curved eyebrows, a wavy mouth line, and several cartoon question marks floating around his head. To the immediate right of the character is a simple, thick-outlined book standing upright, with a flat blue cover and the title \"runbook\" written in simple white text across the front. Next to the book (further to the right) is a large, thick-outlined rectangular panel with a light gray background, featuring a simple, bold black stylized gear icon in the upper center and the word \"tests\" written below it in bold, simple black font. The entire scene is against a plain white background.
